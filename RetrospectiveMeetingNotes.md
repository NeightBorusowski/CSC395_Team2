Sprint #1 Meeting

1: What's going well?
Firstly, Ollama is set up for responses and is sending back data to the frontend as a response from the language model.
While the frontend is continuously going through changes, it is established and it is at a working level. More changes could include changing the UI, loading animations etc.
The formatting of responses seem to be functional and clean, displaying in the text box in the right div.
Communication between the developers is solid, and there is a good use of the ticket system within the GitHub repository. 
Each part of the project is on track and are succeeding
We are meeting often and we discuss via discord and SMS frequently (nearly daily) about the project

2: What challenges have you faced?
The launch json was giving issues within the Github repository which slowed part of the team down
Using the LLM gave some developers RAM issues, and that the model would not work unless the developer had at least around 16gb of ram on their device, slowing some development time down
There are oftentimes issues with getting the tools & technologies to work for the developers, such as trying to make calls to ChatGPT’s API.
Acquiring and paying for ChatGPT API calls for the queries made

3: What can be improved for sprint 2?
To improve, one good code review before going to testing would make the code a lot cleaner, and do some refactoring if applicable to make the code more general and easier for CI/CD, and to add further changes and testing down the line 
To handle technical issues, we will make more use of the ticket system in order to track the commit messages and be able to refer back to the commits once the issue has been solved, and having a log of that issue will also be useful to see the solution in case the solution arises again in the near future.
